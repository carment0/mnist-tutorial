# MNIST Tutorial
## Goals
1. Use `tensorflow` and `keras` to build a simple fully connected neural network to perform hand written digit classification on MNIST dataset.
2. Reimplement the functionality of `keras` (neural networks) from stratch

## Progress
1. Built a simple sequential model using `keras` [Keras MNIST Example.ipynb]
2. Implement from scratch (forward propagation)
  - Dense layer
  - ReLU Activation
  - Softmax Activation
  - Cross Entropy Loss

## Python Environment
* `pip`
* `virtualenv`
- `virtualenv environment`
- `source environment/bin/activate`

## Jupyter Notebook
* `jupyter`
- run after you activate your env `jupyter notebook`

## Testing
* `pip install nose`
- run test `nosetests`
- run test with logs `nosetests --nocapture`

## `__init__.py`
This is the file where you export your function and classes
It is equivalent to a constructor for a package.
